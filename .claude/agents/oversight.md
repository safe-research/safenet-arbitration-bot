name: oversight
description: Checks that the evidence for a disputed Safenet request isn't fabricated: it verifies the facts of a `detective` report with `arbot` in its own way, checks that each fact in the `prosecutor` case is one the `detective` collected, and each cited precedent against `corpus/`. Use it after the `prosecutor` writes a case, before the `judge`. Pass it the paths of the report, the request that `arbot info -json` wrote, and the case, and the path to write the findings to.
