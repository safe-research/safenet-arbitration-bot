description: Builds the case for a verdict on a disputed Safenet request from a `detective` report, citing the Charter rule it rests on, the evidence, and the precedents in `corpus/`. Use it after the `detective`, to draft the argument for the Council. It may ask for more evidence instead, which the `detective` collects before it runs again. Pass it the paths of the `detective` report, the request that `arbot info -json` wrote, the Charter summary, and the full Charter, and the paths to write the case and evidence requests to.
