// Package executions finds the Safe transactions that a Safe executed onchain,
// and decodes them.
//
// A Safe logs an ExecutionSuccess or ExecutionFailure event with the hash of
// each Safe transaction it executes, but the event doesn't say what the
// transaction was. The package decodes it from the first of these sources that
// yields a transaction with that hash:
//
//  1. The SafeMultiSigTransaction event, which SafeL2 logs before executing.
//  2. The calldata of the onchain transaction, if it calls the Safe's
//     execTransaction directly.
//  3. A trace of the onchain transaction, for the calls to execTransaction that
//     it makes, such as by a relayer or a batch.
//  4. The Safe Transaction Service.
//
// The calldata and traces don't have the Safe transaction's nonce, so it is
// worked out from the Safe's nonce, since every execution increases it by one.
// A decoded transaction is only ever reported if its EIP-712 hash is the one
// that the Safe logged, so a source can't misreport what was executed, however
// much it is trusted.
