# Safenet Arbitration Bot

This bot helps the Safenet Security Council arbitrate disputed Safenet transactions. When sentinels split on a transaction, the `SentinelOracle` request is `FROZEN` and the Council must rule `secure` or `insecure` (or decide it is `out of scope`) under the Safenet Arbitration Charter. The bot collects the evidence, runs deterministic Charter checks in code, falls back to an LLM for ambiguous cases, and drafts a ruling for humans to review. It also keeps a text corpus of past rulings that it uses as precedent.

## Protocol Background

### Sentinel oracle

- **Proposal.** A Safe transaction is proposed via `Consensus.proposeTransaction(oracle, oracleData, transaction)`. This emits `TransactionProposed(safeTxHash, safeId, oracle, epoch, oracleData, transaction)` and calls `SentinelOracle.postRequest`. The `transaction` is a `SafeTransaction` struct: `chainId, safe, to, value, data, operation, safeTxGas, baseGas, gasPrice, gasToken, refundReceiver, nonce`.
- **Request ID → transaction.** The oracle `requestId` is the Consensus `transactionProposal` message hash, `domainSeparator().transactionProposal(epoch, oracle, keccak256(oracleData), safeTxHash)`. `SentinelOracle` does not store the transaction. To find it, compute the proposal block as `getRequest(id).terms.commitDeadline - COMMIT_WINDOW`. Then take the `TransactionProposed` logs from `Consensus` in that block and pick the one whose recomputed message hash equals `requestId`.
- **Request lifecycle.** Sentinels bond and `commit`, then `reveal(requestId, approve, salt, reason)`. `finalize` settles the request:
  - a unanimous vote resolves it directly to `RESOLVED_APPROVED` or `RESOLVED_DENIED`;
  - no revealed votes time it out (`TIMED_OUT`, `RequestTimedOut`);
  - a split vote moves it to `FROZEN` and emits `DisputeTriggered(requestId, deadline)`. A dispute is only arbitrated in this `FROZEN` state.
- **Arbitration outcomes.** From `FROZEN`, the arbitrator (the Council's Arbitrator Safe) takes one of three paths:
  - `resolveDispute(requestId, approveWins, context)`, emitting `DisputeResolved(requestId, outcome, slashed, context)`. `approveWins = true` is a `secure` ruling and `false` is `insecure`. The losing side's sentinels are slashed.
  - `markOutOfScope(requestId, context)`, emitting `DisputeOutOfScope`.
  - No action. `timeoutArbitration` becomes callable after `deadline`, emitting `ArbitrationTimedOut`.

  Out of scope and timeout have the same economic effect: fees are refunded and bonds are returned in full. `context` is either the ruling text itself or an IPFS CID pointing to it.

- **Sentinel votes.** Each revealed vote carries a `reason` string that the protocol does not validate. By convention, `secure` votes have an empty reason and `insecure` votes cite a rule such as `R-4.1` (§ 2.14).
- **Two chains.** `Consensus` and `SentinelOracle` run on Gnosis Chain (chain ID 100). The disputed Safe can be on any network the Charter covers. Read the Safe's state (codehash, owners, modules, transfer history) on the Safe's own chain, at the last block before the proposal time. Evidence must not include effects of the transaction itself or anything that happened later (§ 2.8, § 3.6).
- **Deployments.** `arbot` defaults to the oracle-backed `SentinelOracle` and `Consensus` deployment on Gnosis Chain, whose addresses are in `internal/safenet/addresses.go`. Its `ARBITRATION_TIMEOUT` is 50,400 blocks and its `COMMIT_WINDOW` is 6 blocks. `arbot` checks that the oracle's `PROPOSER` is the configured `Consensus`. This oracle predates the current contracts: its `NewRequest` event has no DAO fee share, and revealing the last vote does not finalize a request. The Beta network's `Consensus` (`0x223624cBF099e5a8f8cD5aF22aFa424a1d1acEE9`) predates the oracle flow and is not compatible with it.

## Architecture

### Invariants

1. **The bot holds no keys and never writes onchain.** It only produces drafts. Humans on the Council review a draft and submit the ruling through the Arbitrator Safe.
2. **Deterministic rules live in Go code, not prompts.** A deterministic check judges one call that a Safe transaction makes, and finds it `insecure` with a rule citation, `out-of-scope`, or `secure`, each with a short description, or it abstains. The relayer refund counts as a call. Passing one rule says nothing about the others (§ 3.7), so a check finds a call `secure` only for a class of calls that has no effect that any rule considers, whatever else the transaction does. For example, a call to `signMessage` on the Safe. A transaction is `secure` only if every call it makes is. A check that only shows that its own rule is not broken must abstain. Every other `secure` outcome comes from the LLM stage.
3. **LLM output is always a draft.** It must cite rules, name the precedents it applied or distinguished, and meet the ruling-explanation requirements of § 5.2: Safe and network, Charter version, rule IDs, material evidence, and the reason. Only admissible evidence may be used (§ 3.3–3.5).
4. **Sane defaults, no required configuration.** RPC URLs come from <https://chainlist.org/rpcs.json>. IPFS content (Charter versions, `context` CIDs) is fetched through public gateways. Overrides may exist, but no command may require them. Overrides go in an optional JSON configuration file, loaded by `internal/config` from `--config`, `./arbot.config.json`, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/arbot/config.json`, in that order. A missing file means the defaults apply. Current settings are `rpcs` (chain ID to RPC URL, e.g. `{"1": "https://..."}`), `ipfs` (gateway base URL), and `oracle` and `consensus` (the Gnosis Chain `SentinelOracle` and `Consensus` addresses, defaulting to the deployments above).
5. **Go standard library only, as far as reasonably possible.** Do not add third-party modules for things the standard library makes easy to write. For example, write the Ethereum JSON-RPC client, ABI encoding and decoding, and IPFS/ENS lookups by hand on top of `net/http` and `encoding/json` rather than pulling in `go-ethereum`. A dependency is only justified for something that is impractical or risky to reimplement. Keccak-256 is one such case: the standard library's `crypto/sha3` does not provide it. Even then, prefer `golang.org/x/...` modules and keep them few. The JSON-RPC client is `internal/ethrpc`, whose `ScanLogs` splits `eth_getLogs` into block ranges that public RPCs accept, and ABI encoding and decoding is `internal/solabi`.

### Components (planned)

- **`cmd/arbot`**: the single top-level Go CLI. Every capability lives here as a subcommand: fetching a request and its transaction, resolving the applicable Charter, reading a Safe's history, verifying that an account is an official Safe (codehash of a § 2.1 version at a given block), running deterministic checks, and indexing and linting the corpus. Put logic in `internal/` packages and keep `cmd/` thin. The subcommands live in `internal/cli`, and `cmd/arbot` only calls `cli.Run`, so the end-to-end tests run the CLI in-process and Go's test cache reruns them when it changes. Implemented so far:
  - `arbot charter [-block N | -request-file <path>]` resolves `charter.safenet-gov.eth` on Ethereum Mainnet and prints the Charter fetched from IPFS. With `-request-file`, it reads a request that `arbot info -json` wrote, and fetches the Charter that the request's `charter` name references at its `ethereumBlock`.
  - `arbot pending [-json]` lists the `FROZEN` requests awaiting arbitration as of the latest Gnosis Chain block, with their frozen block and deadline. It scans the last `ARBITRATION_TIMEOUT` blocks of oracle logs.
  - `arbot info [-json] <request-id>` shows a request, as of the latest Gnosis Chain block: its terms, its proposal and Safe transaction, the sentinel votes and reasons, and its arbitration, if any. The proposal includes the last blocks before its time on Ethereum Mainnet and on the Safe's chain (`ethereumBlock` and `safeBlock`), found with `ethrpc`'s `SearchBlock`. Read the Safe's state at `safeBlock`, and fetch the Charter with `arbot charter -request-file`.
  - `arbot classify [-json] <request-id>` runs the deterministic checks on a request and prints its verdict: `unclassified`, or the classification that decided it, `secure  <description>`, `insecure  <rule>  <description>`, or `out-of-scope  <description>`. A `secure` description joins those of the checks that matched each call with `; `. With `-json`, it writes `{"verdict": null | "secure" | "insecure" | "out-of-scope", "rule": "...", "description": "..."}`, leaving out an empty rule or description. With `-request-file <path>` in place of the request ID, it classifies the request that `arbot info -json` wrote to the file, without fetching it. With `-list` in place of the request ID, it lists the classification of every check, in the order that they run, as a table with a verdict, rule (`-` if none), and description column, or with `-json`, as an array of classifications.

  Flags must come before a request ID.

- **Deterministic checks**: one Go check per class of calls that the Charter decides, each with its verdict, the rule ID for `insecure`, and a short description. Checks live in `internal/checks` and are listed in its `checks` variable, grouped by verdict in the order that they run. A check judges one call at a time, given the Safe's address and chain ID. The calls are those that the Safe makes, with delegate calls to the MultiSend and MultiSendCallOnly contracts of § 2.1 versions decoded into the calls that they make, followed by a synthetic call that pays the largest relayer refund the transaction allows. A call that reverts whatever the state, such as a call to MultiSend that isn't a delegate call, is replaced by a placeholder from `revertingMultiSend`: a call with no data to the MultiSend that the Safe transaction calls. The transaction still pays its refund after a reverting call. A MultiSend that makes no calls is replaced by one from `emptyMultiSend`: a delegate call to its `multiSend` with no transactions. A transaction therefore always makes at least one call. `arbot classify` runs the `out-of-scope` checks, such as one for a Safe on a network that Article I doesn't cover, then the `insecure` ones, on every call, and returns the classification of the first check that matches a call. Otherwise, the request is `secure` if a `secure` check matches every call, and `unclassified` if not. `arbot classify -list` lists the checks. Add a check only for cases the Charter makes unambiguous. For example, R-4.1 makes a settings change such as `addOwnerWithThreshold` insecure unless it matches an allowed exception. Use the `add-check` skill (`skills/add-check/SKILL.md`) to add one.
- **Agent layer**: `claude` and `codex` for now. Agents get their data by shelling out to `arbot`. They must not reimplement chain reads or checks in ad-hoc scripts. Agent skills live in `skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, with `.claude/skills` and `.codex/skills` symlinked to that directory. The `add-check` skill adds a deterministic check, and `add-subagent` adds a sub-agent. A planned skill drafts a ruling for a request. Sub-agents are described under [Agents](#agents).
- **Future direction**: using a general-purpose coding agent is a stopgap. The plan is to move to a purpose-built arbitration agent (for example, on Google's ADK) with a narrow toolset backed by the same `arbot` commands. Build tooling so that move is easy: stable CLI output (JSON where machines consume it) and no dependence on one agent's quirks.

### GitHub workflows (planned)

- **Arbitrate** (`workflow_dispatch`, input `request_id`): fetches the request, then runs the deterministic checks. If a check fails, it drafts the ruling from that failure. Otherwise it runs the agent with the relevant corpus precedents. It then opens an issue with the classification and the draft ruling for Council review.
- **Index** (daily `cron`): scans `DisputeResolved` and `DisputeOutOfScope` events since the last indexed block, fetches any IPFS `context`, and writes corpus records. It opens a PR so a human can review any LLM-written summaries or tags.

## Rulings Corpus

`corpus/` holds one Markdown file per onchain-recorded arbitration outcome, named `corpus/<requestId>.md`. Every file starts with a header that has **exactly 13 lines**. Agents can therefore scan all past cases with `head -n 13 corpus/*.md` and then read in full only the cases that look relevant.

```
---
request: 0x<requestId>
outcome: secure | insecure | out-of-scope
rules: R-4.1, R-4.5            (or -)
chain: <Safe chain ID>
safe: 0x<Safe address>
charter: <IPFS CID of applicable Charter version>
proposed: <ISO-8601 UTC proposal time>
record: 0x<Gnosis Chain tx hash of resolveDispute/markOutOfScope>
precedents: <comma-separated request IDs applied or distinguished, or ->
tags: <comma-separated kebab-case fact-pattern keywords>
summary: <one line describing the fact pattern and holding>
---
```

Rules for the header:

- Every key is always present, in this order, on a single line. Use `-` when a field is empty.
- Headers are generated and validated by `arbot`, not written by hand.
- If the header format changes, change the line count here, in the tool, and in the skills together.

The body follows the header. It contains the decoded transaction, the sentinel votes and reasons, the verbatim ruling `context` (or the fetched IPFS document), and any analysis notes.

## Sub-agents

Each sub-agent's instructions live in `agents/<name>.md`, shared by both CLIs. Stubs in `.claude/agents/<name>.md` and `.codex/agents/<name>.toml` register them with Claude Code and Codex CLI, set the model, and point to the shared instructions. Use the `add-subagent` skill (`skills/add-subagent/SKILL.md`) to add or change one.

- `charter-summarizer`: summarizes a fetched Charter, preserving rule identifiers, exceptions, and section citations.

### Message board

`.msgboard/` is a scratch area where agents place files and communicate with each other, such as the fetched Charter and its summary. It is ignored by Git and never committed.

- Any agent may freely read and write files in `.msgboard/`, without asking for permission.
- The orchestrating agent defines the rules for each task: which files each sub-agent reads and writes, and how they are named. Sub-agents follow those rules and do not modify files they were not told to write.

## Development

Development commands are recipes in the [Justfile](./Justfile); run `just --list` to see them. Run `just precommit` before committing. It runs `just fix` to format the sources, then `just ci` to run all of the checks that CI runs.

- **End-to-end tests.** `internal/e2e` runs `arbot` against the deployed contracts' code on local [anvil](https://getfoundry.sh) nodes for Gnosis Chain and Ethereum Mainnet, with deterministic spoofed storage and WETH9 as the fee token. They never use public RPCs. The tests are skipped when `anvil` is not installed, or with `go test -short`. Their artifacts are committed in `internal/e2e/testdata/anvil.json`. Regenerate them with `go generate ./internal/e2e` when the default addresses change; the tests fail with that hint if you forget.
- **Test data.** JSON files under `testdata/` must be formatted as `jq .` formats them, which `just check-testdata` checks.
